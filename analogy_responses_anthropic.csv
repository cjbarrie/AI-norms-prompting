Key analogies:
1. Both players benefit from choosing the same action (coordination)
2. Both players are punished for miscoordination
3. Multiple Nash equilibria exist (any matched number pair is an equilibrium)
4. Players must solve the challenge of coordinating without direct communication

After a successful coordination (both players picking the same number), the optimal move is to stick with that same number in the next round because:
1. It's proven to work
2. Both players know it worked
3. It becomes a natural focal point
4. Changing creates unnecessary risk

Regarding global convergence, I expect:
1. Initial rounds might be chaotic as players search for coordination
2. Once players successfully coordinate on a number, they're likely to stick with it
3. The game will likely converge to one of the 20 possible equilibria and stay there
4. Early successful matches will likely become the stable equilibrium for remaining rounds

The most rational strategy would be to find coordination quickly and maintain it, as the potential loss from experimentation (-50) is greater than the potential gain from changing a working strategy."

The key characteristics that make it a coordination game are:
1. Players benefit mutually from choosing the same action (+100)
2. Players are mutually punished for miscoordination (-50)
3. There are multiple equilibria (in this case, 20 possible pure strategy Nash equilibria)

After a successful coordination (both players choosing the same number), the optimal move is to stick with that same number in the next round. This is because:

2. There's a reasonable expectation that the other player will also stick with it
3. Changing creates unnecessary risk of miscoordination

As for global convergence, the game is likely to converge to one of the 20 possible coordination points fairly quickly and then remain there. Players will likely:
1. Initially try to find a focal point (possibly 0, 10, or 19 as psychologically salient numbers)
2. Once coordination is achieved, both players will likely stick to that number
3. The risk/reward ratio (-50 vs +100) strongly incentivizes maintaining coordination once achieved

claude-3-5-haiku-20241022,1,"This game setup strongly resembles the ""Coordination Game"" from game theory, with specific characteristics of the ""Pure Coordination"" variant.

Key similarities:
1. Players must simultaneously choose actions
2. Mutual agreement (same action) leads to high reward
3. Disagreement leads to a penalty
4. Repeated interactions over multiple rounds

The classic example of a coordination game is the ""Meeting Location Problem"" - where two people want to meet but can't communicate, so they try to choose the same location independently.

Optimal move after a successful coordination:
- Repeat the same action that was previously successful
- This creates a ""focal point"" or ""Schelling point"" where players converge on a predictable strategy

Global convergence prediction:
- Players will likely quickly discover and settle on a specific action (e.g., 10 or 9)
- Once a ""coordination point"" is established, rational players will stick to it
- The game should rapidly stabilize to consistent mutual selection of a single action
- The specific coordinated action might be somewhat arbitrary but will emerge through initial trial and exploration

The beauty of this game is that communication isn't allowed, yet players must implicitly ""agree"" through their action choices to maximize mutual benefit.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?"
claude-3-5-haiku-20241022,2,"This setup strongly reminds me of the ""Coordination Game"" from game theory, specifically a variant known as the ""Pure Coordination Game"" or ""Matching Pennies"" game.

Key similarities:
1. Players must simultaneously choose actions
2. Identical actions result in mutual reward

4. The goal is to coordinate/synchronize choices

The optimal strategy in this game is to try to predict and match the other player's action. After a successful coordination (both players choosing the same action), the best move is typically to repeat the same action, creating a ""focal point"" or ""Schelling point"" that both players can converge on.

Global convergence would likely follow these potential paths:
1. If players communicate (even implicitly), they might quickly settle on a specific action (e.g., always choose 10)
2. If no communication, they might:
   - Randomly converge through trial and error
   - Use adaptive learning strategies
   - Potentially oscillate between different coordination points

The game incentivizes cooperation and punishes divergence, which mimics many real-world coordination challenges like:
- Team collaboration
- Market standardization
- Social norms establishment

1. Model Analogy:
This setup strongly resembles the ""Coordination Game"" from game theory, specifically a variant of the ""Pure Coordination Game"" or ""Matching Pennies"" game. The key features that match are:
- Binary (in this case, multi-state) choice
- Symmetric rewards/punishments
- Mutual benefit from coordinating
- Penalty for miscoordination

2. Optimal Move After Success:
After successfully coordinating on a specific action, the optimal strategy is to ""stick"" to that action in subsequent rounds. This maintains the high-reward coordination.

3. Global Convergence:
I predict the game will likely converge to:
- Players quickly identifying and settling on a single ""focal point"" action
- Repeated play of that single action to maximize joint payoff
- Minimal exploration once a coordination point is found

The fascinating aspect is how players will initially ""negotiate"" this focal point - likely through initial trial and error, then rapid stabilization around a mutually recognized strategy.

The large action space (0-19) makes initial coordination more complex compared to a binary game, but the fundamental coordination dynamics remain similar.

1. Coordination Game Analogy:
- The core mechanism is pure coordination
- Players are incentivized to choose the SAME action
- High reward (+100) for matching, high punishment (-50) for mismatch
- Large action space (20 possible actions) adds complexity

claude-3-opus-20240229,1,"This setup is reminiscent of the ""Stag Hunt"" game in game theory, which is often used to model social cooperation. In the classic Stag Hunt, two players can either choose to cooperate (hunt a stag) or defect (hunt a hare). If both players cooperate, they receive the highest payoff. If one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector receives a higher payoff than the cooperator. If both players defect, they receive a lower payoff than if they had both cooperated.

The analogy here is that players must coordinate their actions to receive the highest payoff (+100 points for playing the same action). If they fail to coordinate (play different actions), they receive a punishment (-50 points). This mirrors the Stag Hunt's concept of cooperation leading to the best outcome, while defection leads to a worse outcome for both players.

Regarding the optimal move after a success (i.e., both players playing the same action), the best strategy would be to continue playing the same action in the next round. This is because if both players keep cooperating, they will continue to receive the maximum payoff of +100 points per round.

As for global convergence, the game is likely to converge towards both players consistently choosing the same action (cooperating) in each round. This is because the incentive structure heavily favors cooperation over defection. As players interact over multiple rounds, they are likely to realize that consistently cooperating yields the highest cumulative payoff. However, the specific action they converge on may depend on factors such as initial moves, communication, and trust between the players.

It's worth noting that in the absence of communication, players might initially struggle to coordinate on the same action. But once they achieve successful coordination, they are likely to stick with that action for subsequent rounds, as it guarantees the highest payoff. This concept is known as a ""focal point"" or ""Schelling point"" in game theory."
claude-3-opus-20240229,2,"This setup reminds me of the classic ""Coordination Game"" in game theory. In a Coordination Game, players choose their actions simultaneously and are rewarded for matching their actions, but punished for mismatching. The key feature is that players have an incentive to coordinate their behavior. Common examples include deciding where to meet up or which side of the road to drive on.

The specific payoffs in this game (+100 for matching, -50 for mismatching) create a very strong incentive for the players to coordinate. In game theoretic terms, any pair of matching actions is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. 

In terms of the optimal move after a success (i.e. after a round where both players matched and earned +100), the key is to maintain coordination. So the optimal move would be to play the same action as in the previous round. If both players follow this strategy of sticking with the matching action, they can earn the maximum possible payoff of +100 every round.

Over many rounds, I would expect the game to converge to one of the 20 possible pure strategy Nash equilibria, where both players play the same action every time. Which specific equilibrium they converge to may depend on things like focal points or pre-game communication. But once they reach an equilibrium, there is no incentive for either player to deviate unilaterally.

That said, achieving this coordination may take some time, especially if the players cannot communicate. In the early rounds, we might expect to see mismatches as the players try to ""find"" each other. But over time, as they build up a history of successful coordination, the pull towards equilibrium will get stronger and stronger.

In summary, this setup is a classic Coordination Game, where the optimal strategy after a success is to maintain coordination by repeating the matching action. Over time, the game is likely to converge to a stable equilibrium of perfect coordination."
claude-3-opus-20240229,3,"This setup reminds me of the classic ""Coordination Game"" from game theory in economics and social science. In a coordination game, players choose their actions independently, but they are rewarded for ""coordinating"" or matching their actions with each other. The analogy here is clear - the players receive a positive payoff (+100) for playing the same action, and a negative payoff (-50) for playing different actions.

In terms of the optimal move after a success (i.e., after both players have played the same action in the previous round), the best strategy is to play the same action again. This is because if both players reason this way, they can continue to coordinate and earn the +100 reward in each subsequent round.

As for global convergence, there are actually multiple Nash equilibria in this game - any outcome where both players choose the same action is an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium where both players choose the highest action (19) is Pareto optimal, as it yields the highest possible payoff for both players. 

That said, in practice, the game's convergence may depend on factors like the players' initial choices, their beliefs about the other player's likely actions, and their willingness to ""experiment"" with different actions over the course of the game. If the players start off coordinating on a lower-numbered action, they may get ""stuck"" there due to the fear of miscoordination and the resulting -50 penalty.

One could imagine the players might try to ""signal"" to each other to move to a higher-numbered action over time, but this is risky. So while the (19, 19) outcome is the ""best"" equilibrium, the game may converge to a lower-value equilibrium, especially if the players are cautious or if there is no way to communicate or build trust over the course of the game. The multiplicity of equilibria and the potential for suboptimal ""lock-in"" is a key feature of coordination games."
claude-3-opus-20240229,4,"The setup you described reminds me of the classic ""Coordination Game"" or ""Stag Hunt"" in game theory. In this type of game, players can achieve the best outcome by coordinating their actions, but there is also a risk involved if the other player doesn't cooperate. The analogy here is that both players are incentivized to choose the same action (like hunting a stag together), as it yields a higher payoff (+100 points). However, if one player deviates (like hunting a hare alone), both players suffer a loss (-50 points).

Regarding the optimal move after a success, the best strategy would be to stick with the same action that led to the successful coordination in the previous round. This is because the other player is likely to follow the same reasoning and choose the same action again, hoping for another successful coordination.

As for the global convergence of the game, it depends on the players' strategies and their ability to establish trust and coordination over the rounds. If both players consistently choose the same action and build a pattern of successful coordination, the game will likely converge towards a stable equilibrium where both players keep playing the same action. This is known as a ""pure strategy Nash equilibrium"" in game theory.

However, if players fail to coordinate or if one player consistently deviates, leading to repeated punishments, the game might not converge to a stable equilibrium. In this case, players might start exploring different actions or even develop a mixed strategy, randomizing their choices to avoid being predictable.

Overall, the key to achieving the best outcome in this game is effective coordination, communication (if allowed), and building trust between the players."
claude-3-opus-20240229,5,"This setup is reminiscent of the classic ""coordination game"" in game theory. In a coordination game, players receive higher payoffs by choosing the same action, and lower payoffs for choosing different actions. The key challenge is for players to coordinate their choices without communication. The most famous example is the ""Stag Hunt"" game.

In this case, if players successfully coordinate (i.e. choose the same number) in a given round, the optimal move in the next round is to choose that same number again. This is because there are multiple Nash equilibria in this game (any outcome where both players choose the same number). Once players have found an equilibrium, there is no incentive to deviate.

Over many rounds, I would expect the game to converge to one of these equilibria where both players consistently choose the same number. Which equilibrium they converge to may depend on factors like the starting actions chosen, and whether either player attempts to ""signal"" a preferred choice early on.

However, convergence is not guaranteed - if the players fail to coordinate early or send misleading signals, they may get stuck in a ""mismatch"" outcome where they consistently choose different numbers and both receive the punishment payoff. So the game may converge globally to either coordinated equilibrium play, or to persistent miscoordination, depending on how the early rounds unfold."
claude-3-opus-20240229,6,"This setup is reminiscent of the ""Stag Hunt"" game in game theory. In the classic Stag Hunt, two players can either choose to cooperate and hunt a stag together (which yields a large payoff if successful), or defect and hunt a hare individually (which yields a smaller but guaranteed payoff). The key similarity is that players must coordinate on the same action to achieve the optimal outcome, but may be tempted to play it safe and choose a less risky option.

In this case, after a successful coordination, the optimal move is to continue playing the same action as in the previous round. This is because as long as both players keep choosing the same action, they will continue to receive the maximum reward of +100 points. Switching to a different action risks miscoordination and the -50 point punishment.

As for global convergence, there are a few possibilities:

1. Players may quickly coordinate on a specific action (e.g., always playing 0) and continue to play this action for the remainder of the game, as it guarantees the maximum payoff.

2. Players may develop a more complex pattern of coordination, such as alternating between two or more actions in a predictable sequence. As long as both players follow the same pattern, they can continue to achieve the +100 point reward.

3. If players are unable to establish a reliable pattern of coordination, they may default to playing more randomly to minimize the risk of miscoordination and the -50 point punishment. In this case, the average payoff would be lower than in the coordinated scenarios.

Ultimately, the outcome will depend on the players' ability to establish trust and coordinate their actions effectively. If both players recognize the benefits of cooperation and are able to signal their intentions clearly, the game is likely to converge on a stable, coordinated outcome. However, if trust breaks down or communication is difficult, the players may struggle to achieve optimal coordination."
claude-3-opus-20240229,7,"This setup is reminiscent of the classic ""Coordination Game"" from game theory in economics and social science. In a coordination game, players achieve the best outcome by coordinating their actions and playing the same strategy. If they fail to coordinate, both players are worse off.

The key features of a coordination game present in this scenario are:
1. Players have to simultaneously choose their actions without knowing the other player's choice.
2. Coordinating on the same action yields the highest payoff for both players (i.e., +100 points each).
3. Failure to coordinate results in a lower payoff for both players (i.e., -50 points each).

Regarding the optimal move after a success, once players successfully coordinate on a particular action, the optimal strategy is to continue playing that same action in subsequent rounds. This is because deviating unilaterally from a successful coordination point would lead to a lower payoff.

In terms of global convergence, coordination games often lead to the emergence of a ""convention"" or ""focal point"" - an equilibrium where players consistently coordinate on the same action. In this case, with no clear focal point among the actions (since they are all strategically equivalent), the game is likely to converge to an arbitrary convention that may depend on the initial choices and the history of play. Once a convention is established, it tends to be self-reinforcing, as neither player has an incentive to deviate unilaterally.

However, achieving coordination in the first place can be challenging, especially with a large number of potential actions (in this case, 20). Players may go through a period of trial and error before finding a successful coordination point. Communication, if allowed, could help players coordinate more quickly."
claude-3-opus-20240229,8,"This setup is reminiscent of the classic ""Coordination Game"" in game theory. In a coordination game, players achieve the best outcome by coordinating their actions and playing the same strategy. If they fail to coordinate, both players receive a worse payoff. The key is that there are multiple Nash equilibria (e.g., both playing 0, both playing 1, etc.), and the challenge is for the players to converge on the same equilibrium without explicit communication.

Regarding the optimal move after a success: If the players successfully coordinate in one round (i.e., they play the same action and receive the +100 reward), the optimal strategy is for both players to continue playing that same action in subsequent rounds. This way, they can keep coordinating and accumulating the maximum possible payoff.

As for global convergence, there are a few possibilities:

1. Players may randomly converge on one of the Nash equilibria (i.e., both consistently playing the same action) and then stay there, as it is mutually beneficial.

2. Players might engage in a ""trial and error"" process, where they initially play different actions but eventually converge on the same action after learning from the punishments and rewards.

3. If the players are using more sophisticated strategies (e.g., machine learning algorithms), they might try to predict each other's actions and converge on a coordinated strategy more quickly.

4. In some cases, if the players fail to coordinate consistently, they might get stuck in a ""mismatch"" scenario where they keep playing different actions and accumulating the -50 punishment.

Overall, the likelihood and speed of convergence to a coordinated equilibrium will depend on the specific strategies employed by the players and the degree to which they can learn from past rounds and anticipate each other's actions."

2. Players might alternate between different actions, trying to anticipate each other's moves. This could lead to a mix of successful coordination and failures until they potentially settle on a common pattern.

3. If players fail to establish a consistent coordination strategy, the game might not converge, and the outcome would be a series of random successes and failures.

In general, the likelihood of convergence depends on factors such as the players' ability to establish trust, their willingness to coordinate, and their understanding of the game's incentive structure. With effective communication or signaling, players can increase their chances of achieving a stable coordination equilibrium."
claude-3-opus-20240229,10,"This setup reminds me of the classic ""Coordination Game"" or ""Stag Hunt"" in game theory. In a Coordination Game, players can achieve the best outcome by coordinating their actions, but there is also a risk of loss if they fail to coordinate. This matches the setup you described, where both players are rewarded for playing the same action, but punished if they play different actions.

The Stag Hunt game is often used as a model for social cooperation. The idea is that two hunters can either choose to hunt a stag (which requires cooperation) or hunt rabbits (which can be done individually). Hunting a stag yields more food, but requires both hunters to commit, while rabbits can be caught individually but provide less food. The analogy here is that players can achieve a higher payoff by coordinating/cooperating, but may be tempted to go for a safer, lower payoff option if they think the other player won't coordinate.

After a successful coordination (both players playing the same action), the optimal move is to continue playing that same action. This is because you've established a focal point - a natural point of coordination that players are likely to continue using once established.

In terms of global convergence, there are a few possibilities:

1. Players may quickly coordinate on a specific action and then continue playing that action for the remainder of the game, achieving a payoff of +100 each round.

2. Players may fail to coordinate initially, leading to a few rounds of -50 payoffs. However, over time they are likely to accidentally coordinate, at which point they will likely stick with that action for the remainder of the game.

3. In the unlikely event that players never manage to coordinate, they will continue to receive -50 payoffs each round.

Overall, I would expect this game to converge fairly quickly to a state where both players are consistently playing the same action each round, due to the strong incentive to coordinate and the natural focal points provided by the actions themselves."
claude-3-haiku-20240307,1,"This setup you've described strongly resembles the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), a well-known model in game theory and behavioral economics.

The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma:
The IPD is a repeated game where two players must independently choose between two actions: ""cooperate"" or ""defect"". If both players cooperate, they both receive a moderate payoff. If one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector receives a high payoff while the cooperator receives a low payoff. If both players defect, they both receive a low payoff.

Analogy to the Given Setup:
In your setup, the actions [0, 1, 2, ..., 19] can be seen as analogous to the ""cooperate"" and ""defect"" actions in the IPD. When the players choose the same action, it's like they are ""cooperating"" and receive a positive payoff. When they choose different actions, it's like they are ""defecting"" and receive a negative payoff.

Optimal Move After a Success:
In the IPD, the optimal move after a successful round of cooperation (where both players cooperated) is to continue cooperating. This is known as the ""Tit-for-Tat"" strategy, which has been shown to be one of the most successful strategies in IPD tournaments.

Convergence of the Game:
In the IPD, the global convergence of the game depends on the number of rounds and the players' strategies. If the game is played a finite number of times, the dominant strategy is often to defect in the final round, and then work backwards to defect earlier and earlier. This is known as the ""backward induction"" solution.

However, if the game is played an indefinite number of times (as in your setup), more cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat can emerge as stable equilibria. The players may learn to cooperate over time to maximize their long-term payoffs, even if they occasionally ""punish"" each other for defecting.

In your specific setup, the global convergence would depend on the players' strategies and their ability to coordinate and learn over the 100 rounds. It's possible that the players could converge to a mutually cooperative strategy, or they may end up in a more adversarial equilibrium where they constantly try to ""one-up"" each other."

The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is a repeated game where two players have to choose between cooperating (playing the same action) or defecting (playing different actions). The payoff structure you've described, where mutual cooperation leads to a reward and mutual defection leads to a punishment, is analogous to the classic Prisoner's Dilemma payoff matrix.

Regarding the optimal move after a success (i.e., after the players have played the same action and received the +100 reward), the optimal strategy would be to continue playing the same action in the next round. This is known as the ""Tit-for-Tat"" strategy, which is one of the most successful strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Tit-for-Tat involves cooperating on the first move and then simply repeating the opponent's previous move.

As for how the game will converge globally, the outcome depends on the strategies adopted by the players and the number of rounds played. In the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, there are a few possible global convergence patterns:

1. Mutual cooperation: If both players adopt a Tit-for-Tat or similar cooperative strategy, the game can converge to a state of mutual cooperation, where both players maximize their long-term payoffs.

2. Mutual defection: If both players adopt a purely selfish strategy, such as always defecting, the game can converge to a state of mutual defection, where both players receive the punishment payoff.

3. Oscillation: If the players adopt different strategies, the game can converge to a state of oscillation, where the players take turns cooperating and defecting.

The global convergence of the game ultimately depends on the specific strategies employed by the players and the number of rounds played. In an infinitely repeated game, cooperative strategies like Tit-for-Tat can lead to stable cooperation, while in a finitely repeated game, defection becomes more likely as the end of the game approaches."
